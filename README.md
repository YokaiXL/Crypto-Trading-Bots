With Python-coded beginner-level bots, you will be able to quickly and easily gain insights into the market. I will create a separate README file for each bot, providing information about the bot's purpose, the parameters and pairs it analyzes, and how to interpret the outputs it provides. 

To use these bots, you first need to create an API key on CoinMarketCap (https://coinmarketcap.com). Selecting the free version will be sufficient. Using the data we retrieve from CoinMarketCap, we will have access to most of the necessary information.
